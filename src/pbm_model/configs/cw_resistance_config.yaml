# --- Data Source ---
source: "CFD_WITH_ROUGHNESS"   # Must be one of AVAILABLE_SOURCES

# --- Column Names (High-Frequency Sensor Data) ---
columns:
  speed: "SPEED_THROUGH_WATER_LONG"   # Ship speed column (m/s)
  draft: "DRAFT_MEAN"                  # Ship draft column (m)

# --- RBF Interpolator Settings ---
interpolator:
  # Kernel options:
  #   'thin_plate_spline' - recommended for smooth data
  #   'cubic'             - C2 continuous, good for extrapolation
  #   'multiquadric'      - good for non-negative extrapolation
  #   'linear', 'gaussian', 'inverse_multiquadric'
  kernel: "multiquadric"

  # Epsilon: scaling parameter for the RBF kernel.
  # Set to null to auto-compute from data via determine_epsilon().
  # Once computed, paste the logged value here to lock it in across runs.
  epsilon: null   # e.g. 1.4832

  # Smoothing: regularization term to avoid ill-conditioned systems.
  smoothing: 0.001
